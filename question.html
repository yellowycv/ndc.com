            <h3>What is NDC?</h3>
            <p>The acronym NDC stands for Nasarawa Diamond Council, established on 9th October, 2021. It is the restoration arm of the people of Nasarawa State and Nigeria as a whole. It is a Non-Profit Organization representing all ethnic groups of Nasarawa people to bring development and empowerment at the community and society level. 
                The Council arose out of the need to implement the Global Restoration Plan instituted by the Guardian of the worldâ€™s assets and Sole Trustee of the Global Repository of the World Trust.
                We have assembled ourselves here in Nasarawa State, Nigeria to bring to life our inherited abilities to purposely restore and empower our state.
                As a sovereign citizen of Nigeria, we proclaim to honor, empower, encourage, and sustain our individuality and entrepreneurial essence through the law of nature, God-given Right, the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness, promoting an inclusive voice of the people to self-govern our lives.
            </p>

        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>What is the Restoration Plan all about?</h3>
            <p>It is an effort to reform the world systems in line with the Natural law. To shift from a debt-based system to an asset/knowledge-based transitional economic system. It is a plan to restore the earth to her state of health before the darkness took over control.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>What is the Global Repository?</h3>
            <p>The Global Repository was established by the Trustee as a new designation for the financial aspect of the Quantum Mapping System of the World Trust. It is a replacement for all Central Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank, which is the custodian of all World currencies and the only tier 1 bank. Now all countries have a Repository connected with the assets of each country.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
            <p>Everybody of goodwill who has ideas, expertise, businesses, projects that can benefit the people. Entrepreneurs (self-employed and business owners) are essential in this. But everyone who has something to give to improve Nigeria, no matter how small. We need people from all sectors of the economy in all the value chains, from harnessing the natural resources, processing, manufacturing, logistics to retailing, who will follow our ethical guidelines to take charge and gradually replace the Monopolies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>How can one participate?</h3>
            <p>You need to have a project. It could be a new or existing business, idea, innovation, talent, or anything that will uplift humanity and the environment. Then you join the Council by volunteering.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>Are the funds in the form of grants? Grants are controversial, what is the guarantee?</h3>
            <p>Yes, the funds come in the form of grants because a grant is the only available word used to describe funds that are not a loan. Grants are usually given by individuals or organizations that have made a lot of money and want to give back as a humanitarian gesture. It is different here. Here we have an institution that doesn't make money but is holding all the natural resources or assets of the earth and converts them to money. So we are talking about an entitlement of every human being. It is not a grant in the normal sense. We have the opportunity to access the Repository for Nigeria in the Global Repository of World Trust.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>What if I don't have a project or an innovation?</h3>
            <p>You can find someone who has one that you can work with as a partner or employee. But everyone can think up a project. You can also look at what you enjoy doing, what you are good at or exceptional in. You can also carry out a needs assessment in your community and you will surely find something. Or meet people on Life force and Gforce to collaborate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-section">
            <h3>Where is the funding coming from?</h3>
            <p>Funding for the projects will come from the Global Repository of the World Trust. The world banking system has been restructured (K.I.M.S. Key Integrated Monetary System).</p>
