        <h1 id="care-ndc">REGARDING LIFE AND NATURE</h1>
        <p>
            1. All life is sacred and humanity is responsible for the well-being of all life on the planet. Natural Law applies to all inhabitants of this planet and beyond. This principle is innate within every sentient being. Therefore, all life must be engaged with love, considering the role each of us plays in the overall ecosystem of our planet.
            <br><br>
            2. Humanity is free and independent from the time of their birth. All rights associated with this freedom are the peoplesâ€™ to define. The posterity of the family is the responsibility of the parents, who should provide for, educate and support the natural healthy development of each child until the child is able to do so for himself or herself. The parent has the right to do this in any way they see fit so long as they are not abusive, or in violation of the Natural Laws that govern each community.
            <br><br>
            3. No one shall be held in slavery; slavery and the slave-trade in all their forms shall be prohibited. No one shall be held in servitude.
            <br><br>
            4. No child or adult shall be sexually exploited in any way, including all forms of pedophilia.
            <br><br>
            5. All malicious acts against humanity must stop immediately or be punished according to the Law of the Land.
            <br><br>
            6. Earth, food, water, and air are essential components to life on earth. It is a crime against humanity to alter these core components in any way that negatively affects human vitality. Companies, organizations, government offices, and individuals must conduct regular audits of their operations, and cease and desist any action that negatively impacts life on earth.
            <br><br>
            7. The people recognize that there are things that exist that may be invisible, metaphysical, or immeasurable that have tangible value. It is part of the human experience to seek inner-standing of our origins, powers latent within, and potential. Therefore, people are free to communicate, observe, practice, participate, believe, or create any spiritual, energetic, or religious activity so long as it does not hurt others, incite violence, or violate Natural Law and the fundamental rights of the people. These rights will be protected without exception.
