        <h1 id="about-ndc">About Nasarawa Diamond Council</h1>
        <p>
            NDC was established on 9th October, 2021. It is the restoration arm of the people of Nasarawa State and Nigeria as a whole. It is a Non-Profit Organization representing all ethnic groups of Nasarawa people to bring development and empowerment at the community and society level. 
            The Organization arose out of the need to implement the Global Restoration Plan instituted by the Guardian of the worldâ€™s assets and Sole Trustee of the Global Repository of the World Trust.
            We have Assembly ourselves here in Nasarawa State Nigeria to bring to life our inherited abilities to purposely restore and empower our state.

            As a sovereign citizen of Nigeria, we proclaim to honor, empower, encourage and sustain our individuality and entrepreneurial essence through the law of nature, God-given Right, the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, promoting an inclusive voice of the people to self-govern our lives.

        <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>
            In nature, growth and development starts from the ground up. The strength of a tree lies in the roots in the ground. All human structures should take the same path. The structure should be built from the ground up. Real power should lie at the base, at the community level formed by the individual.
According to natural law every structure should be a bottom up structure. Starting from the family unit forming the community to state, region then country.
The Nasarawa Diamond Council is a representation at the state level. And so it must represent all peoples or ethnic groups in Nasarawa state. It will build a structure at LGA levels  as a model for the future to assist and support the communities to achieve self- governance and to build up from the ground a new and to gradually replace the Council Structure in the future.

        </p>
        
        <h2>Council Logo</h2>
        <p>
            The logo was designed and approved by the Council on the 11th October, 2021. 
            The design of the logo displays a map of the state known as the home of solid minerals. The outline color on the map represents purity, with the map of the world in the background, indicating the extension of the blessings to the whole world.
            The three mineral resources placed on the map indicate the mineralization potentials of pegmatites in the State. 
            The circle at the left and right represent a universal symbol with extensive meaning. It signifies totality and wholeness, and also represents a group of people with shared professions, interests, or acquaintances.
